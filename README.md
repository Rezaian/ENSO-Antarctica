# ENSO and Antarctica Climate Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes the impact of El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases on various climate variables in Antarctica, including mean sea level pressure (MSLP), total precipitation, and 10m wind vectors.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains raw datasets used in the analysis.
- **scripts/**: Contains Python scripts for performing the analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis and visualization.
- **results/**: Contains results of the analysis, including figures and reports.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies.
- **LICENSE**: License for the code.

## Installation
To set up the environment and run the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rezaian/ENSO-Antarctica.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ENSO-Antarctica
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
